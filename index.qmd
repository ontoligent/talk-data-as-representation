## Critical Data Studies

> Critical Data Studies is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that addresses the ethical, legal, social, cultural, epistemological and political aspects of data science, **big data** and digital infrastructures.

[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/critical-data-studies/about.php)

> Critical Data Studies (CDS) explore the unique cultural, ethical, and critical challenges posed by **Big Data**.

## Big Data

That we live in the era of "big data" is a **commonplace**

- In fact, it has become a tired **meme**

Often understood in purely **technical** terms

- 3D data, etc.

But it also means something like **Big Science**

- i.e. *Big Data-Science* ...

## Big Data

This media usage is typical:

## Big Data

So, Big Data has a dual meaning

- As a kind of **data** --- 3D (Volume, Velocity, Variety)
- As a kind of **institution** --- built around data

CDS focuses on how these meanings are related\
\
$\rightarrow$ To understand this relation, let's begin at the beginning

## Society

The basic unit of society is the **relationship**, not the individual

- The view from anthropology (Marylin Strathern, Roy Wagner)

Consider **gender**

- Cross-culturally, the concept fundamentally defines a relationship, not an individual identity

- The dyad male-female defines a collection of complementarities

**Society** as a whole is constructed from of these relationships

## Representation

-   Social relations are always mediated by a form of representation
    -   Language, ritual, money, etc.
    -   These are "social media"
    -   Considered essential to society
-   Relationships are **constituted** by these media

## Scale

-   Different media forms are associated with different social forms
-   Large-scale societies require writing
-   The liberal democratic nation state emerged with the newspaper
-   Democracy runs on public opinion, which is represented by the media
-   Principle of emergence

## Data as Medium

-   Data has become a dominant social medium
-   Significance of "big data"
-   Every significant social relationship is now mediated by data

## Googlization

-   Hal Varian's model of the networked computer as disintermediator

## Effects

-   Cognitive
-   Social

## Thick Mediation

## Web3
