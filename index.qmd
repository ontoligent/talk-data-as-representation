## What is Critical Data Studies?

> Critical Data Studies is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that addresses the ethical, legal, social, cultural, epistemological and political aspects of data science, **big data** and digital infrastructures.

<small>[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/critical-data-studies/about.php)</small>

> Critical Data Studies (CDS) explore the unique cultural, ethical, and critical challenges posed by **Big Data**.

## Big Data

That we live in the era of "big data" is a **commonplace**

- In fact, it has become a tired **meme**

Commonly understood as a purely **technical** idea

- 3D data, etc.
- 4^th^ Paradigm of Science

But: It also means something like Big Science or Big Pharma

- i.e. **Big Data-Science** ...

## Big Data Science

For example, this usage is typical in the media:

<small>[Big Data's Big Problem: Little Talent (*WSJ*, April 29, 2012)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304723304577365700368073674)</small>

Here Big Data is a **synonym for Data Science**

## Big Data and CDS

CDC focuses on Big Data from this dual perspective

- As a kind of **data** --- 3D (Volume, Velocity, Variety) \
- As a kind of **institution** --- built around data

CDS focuses on how the **levels** of technology and society **related**

## Society is Relational

So, the basic unit of society is the **relationship**, not the individual

- The view from **anthropology** (Marylin Strathern, Roy Wagner)

Consider male/female, parent/child, consumer/producer, labor/capital, etc.

- Each dyad defines a relationship, not an individual identity
- Each dyad contains a collection of **complementarities** of normative **traits and behaviors**

---

**Society** as a whole is constructed from of these relationships

_If you want to change society, you change these relationships_ [^1]

[^1]: Easier said than done :-) 

## Relations are Mediated

Social relations are **mediated** forms of **representation**

- Language, writing, ritual, money, etc.
- These literally are **social media** (a term coined in the 19^th^ c.)

Relationships are **constituted** by social media

- Both there forms and their contents
- E.g. orality and specific myths

## Media Enables Scale

Different media forms are associated with different **social forms**

- **Large-scale societies** (states) require **writing**
- The liberal democratic nation state emerged with the **newspaper** (~18^th^ c.)
- Not a causal relationship, but systemic

Democracy runs on **public opinion**, which is represented by the **media**

## Data is a Social Medium

Now, Big Data means that data has become a **dominant social medium**

 - Finance, commerce, labor, education, romance, etc.
 - **Web3** is the idea that government itself will be replaced by data (Blockchain)

_**Nearly every significant social relationship is now mediated by data**_

- This is **historically singular** --- and recent

## Signifance

This is more than saying we are dependent on the Big Data economy

- Or that Big Data is **disruptive**
- Or that Big Data is **biased**
- Or that Big Data is **spying on us**

It is saying that the structure of our society and the content of our culture are changing

- _**What are these new forms of life?**_

## So what?
