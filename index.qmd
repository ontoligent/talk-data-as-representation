## What is Critical Data Studies?

> Critical Data Studies is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that addresses the ethical, legal, social, cultural, epistemological and political aspects of data science, **big data** and digital infrastructures.

<small>[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/critical-data-studies/about.php)</small>

> Critical Data Studies (CDS) explore the unique cultural, ethical, and critical challenges posed by **Big Data**.

## Big Data

That we live in the era of "big data" is a **commonplace**

-   In fact, it has become a tired **meme**

Commonly understood as a purely **technical** idea

-   3D data, 4^th^ Paradigm of Science, etc.

But: It also means something like Big Science or Big Pharma

-   i.e. **Big Data-Science** ...

## Big Data Science

For example, this usage is typical in the media:

![](images/wsj-big-data.jpg){.shadow} <small>[Big Data's Big Problem: Little Talent (*WSJ*, April 29, 2012)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304723304577365700368073674)</small>

Here Big Data is a **synonym for Data Science**

## Big Data and CDS

CDS focuses on Big Data from this dual perspective

-   As a kind of **technology** --- 3D (Volume, Velocity, Variety)
-   As a kind of **institution** --- built around data

Here, I'd like to sketch out an **anthropological framework** for studying how these levels **interoperate**

-   Presented as a series of **propositions**

## 1 Society is Relational

Society is built out of **relationships**, not individuals

-   Relationships have a basis that **precedes so-called rational action**
-   In contrast to **methodological individualism**

At least we can agree that **relationships are foundational to society**

## Relational Dyads

By relationship, I mean relational **dyads** ---

> `male/female`, `parent/child`, `consumer/producer`, `labor/capital`, `student/teacher`, `doctor/patient`, `us/them`, `I/thou`, etc.

Each specifies **complementary traits** and **expected behaviors**

## 2 Social Relations are Mediated

Social relations are **mediated** by forms of **representation**

-   Language, writing, ritual, money, etc.
-   These literally are **social media** (a term coined in the 19^th^ c.)

Relationships are **constituted** by these media

-   Both their forms and their contents
-   E.g. orality and specific myths

## 3 Media Enable Scale

Different **media forms** are associated with different emergent **social orders**

-   **Large-scale societies** (states) require **writing**
-   The liberal democratic **nation state** emerged with the **newspaper** (\~18^th^ c.)
    -   Not causal, but **systemic**
-   Democracy runs on **public opinion**, which is represented by the **media**

## 4 Data is a Social Medium

Now, Big Data means that data has become a **dominant social medium**

-   Finance, commerce, labor, education, romance, etc.

Therefore, it is bound up with **emerging social (and cultural) orders**

## Reintermediation

The trend over the past three decades has been the progressive **reintermediation** of social relations

-   Within the **economic** and **private social** spheres
-   Most recently, **Web3** is the idea that government itself will be replaced by data (Blockchain)
    -   a society without trust

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {style="color:red;font-size:110%;"}
**Nearly every significant social relationship is now mediated by data**
:::

-   This is **historically singular** --- and recent

Data mediates both as **social agent** and **cognitive form**

-   This is a very big deal

## Significance

It is not simply that we have become **dependent** on the Big Data economy

Or that Big Data is **disruptive**, or **biased**, or **spying on us** . . . all of which are important

It is means that there are **system-level changes** taking place right now

----

At the level of **sectors**

- Education, medicine, banking, etc.

At the level of **political economic orders**

- Akin to Polanyi's *Great Transformation*
- Akin to the rise of the nation state

----

But since society is built on relationships, we can empirically study these systemic phenomena **on the ground** by investigating mediated social relationships

- Ethnographically
- Statistically
- From a "business" perspective ...

## Examples

Two examples:

-   `Patient-Doctor` relations in **medicine**
-   `Student-Teacher` relations in **education**

This relations are increasingly mediated by **platforms** that both **connect and distance**

-   capture data
-   contextualize with analytics
